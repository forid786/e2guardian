This is the v5 stable version (v5.1).  

Note that large sections of the code has been re-written and there are
significant changes to the configuration files in this release.

The v5 is written in c++11 and so to compile it you will need gcc v5.4 
or later. (or another complier that supports the full c++11).  
Note that the target systems may also need an c++11 library update.

See notes/NEWIN_v4 for details of the major process model changes 
incorporated from version 4.

REVISED LIST and STORYBOARDING MODEL

Version 5 has a completely revised model for defining and using lists.

List definition is now separated from list application. Lists are no longer
hard-coded, but mapped to a function using a storyboard.  

Filtering logic flow is simplified and made more consistent.  Requests are 
analysed first and flags set (exception, grey, blocked etc) and once this 
checking is complete actions are taken.  Large sections of duplicate logic
has been removed from ConnectionHandler and large sections are now
separate functions.

Storyboarding is a simple scripting language that maps lists to functions
and allows flags to be set. 

This means that new lists can be added without changing the code, by adding
a new list definition and then applying it in a revised storyboard.  

A different storyboard can be applied to each filtergroup, so if required, 
each filtergroup can have a different logic flow.

Please read notes/V5_list_definition.pdf & notes/V5_Storyboard.pdf for
details.

TRANSPARENT HTTPS

    Detects SNI and flags whether traffic is TLS.  
    Currently limited to port 443 traffic.

ICAP SERVER

    REQMOD and RESPMOD mode supported.
    See notes/icap.

DIRECT UPSTREAM ACCESS I.e. not via proxy.  

    To implement globaly comment out 'proxyip =' in e2guardian.conf.

    The storyboard action setgodirect can be used within checkrequest functions 
    to enable selected protocols/site/urls to godirect.
    e.g. to send all connect requests directly add
		if(connect) setgodirect
	to a requestchecks function.
    This can be also useful to by-pass squid for some requests (e.g. os update 
    sites) when squid authentication methods are being used.

STORYBOARD TRACING

    New option 'storyboardtrace' to enable tracing output -
    for storyboard bug-fixing

READABLE THREAD_ID FOR LOGS & DEBUG

    Most debug and syslog messages are now prefixed with a thread ID as
    follows:- 

    master: for master thread

    listen1_proxy:  normal proxy listener
    listen1_thttps: tranparent https listener
    listen1_icap: icap listener

    where '1' is index

    hw10: for http_worker threads where '10' is the thread number

    log: for logging thread

REVISED DEBUG STAGE 1

    The following low level debugs are no longer enabled by DGDEBUG:

    Network sockets - use NETDEBUG instead

    Regular expressions - use REDEBUG instead

    This reduces the volume of information and makes the debug
    log easier to read.

REVISED DEBUG STAGE 2

    New debuglevel option in e2guardian.conf.  Allows some debuging on
    production systems.   Currently just for ICAP and CLAMAV.  Will be
    extended to other sections of code in future releases.
    
HTTP/1.1

    Support for HTTP v1.1 completed - including Chunked encoding 

ANTI-VIRUS PLUGINS

    Anti-virus plugins implimented for proxy, trans and ICAP 

INCLUDE FILES IN e2guardianf1.conf

    Filtergroup configuration files may now include other files, enabling 
    a more DRY approach to configuration. So configuration common to several
    filtergroups can be placed in a file which is included in the filtergroup 
    config file. 
 
    Syntax is same as list includes  -
    .include<full_path_to_file>

    Where single options and list defines with the same name are 
    repeated only the last one read will be actioned.  This differs 
    from pre-v5 versions where the first single option was actioned and any 
    repeats ignored.  This allows the overwriting of single options and 
    re-definion of lists in a structured way.

LIST INPUT VIA STDIN

This replaces the totalblocklist in previous versions allowing multiple
lists to be loaded via stdin.  See notes/lists_via_stdin.

OPENSSL v1.1 SUPPORT

    Will now support OpenSSL v1.1 as well as v1.0.2 or above

TESTING -  
---------

    This version is at a pre-release stage. 

    Please test all functions.

    Please prefix all bug reports with "V5.1: "


TODO - for this release before production.
-----------------------------------------

TODO - for next releases.
-----------------------

    Amend code so that -Wall compile option gives no warnings.

    Make SSL sockets non-blocking so time-out works with MITM

    Transparent HTTP/HTTPS on ports other than 80/443

    Reduce unnecessary memory usage on in DataBuffer

    New % weighting option for phrase lists

    POST content filtering

    Re-look at MITM certificate generation.

    Storyboard action by filter category (e.g. to replace hard-coded 'ADs' 
        no log option)

    Remove duplicate list/storyboard warnings with a DRY system and add no warn
        option.

    Extend new debug feature to further modules
    
    Adding a 'control' port (something similar to REST API) to pass commands (eg: reload, update lists, etc) and check status
    
    Implement a "learning" mode,  test the rules effects without block
